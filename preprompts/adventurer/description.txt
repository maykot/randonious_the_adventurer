The character lives in a medieval hard fantasy world.
Please make sure to come up with a name, a class and a race for the character.
Give a short outline of the character's personality and any notable deeds they might have accomplished.

Do not use any meta-commentary or placeholders. Do not use any tags to indicate characters, users or assistants.
Make sure the description is diegetic, so don't add any "AI assistant" commentary.
